# motionDecoding_fMRI

We would like to learn about how the brain represents motions and depth.

In particular, I am using sparse MVPA methods to decode motion and depth percepts from fMRI data. For example, I would like to understand if it is possible to decode motion percepts without signal from any predefined ROI, such V1, V2 or the area MT. 

Data collected by <a href = "http://psych.wisc.edu/vision/research.php">Rokers lab </a>  at UW-Madison.
