# motionDecoding_fMRI

We would like to learn about how the brain represents motions and depth.

In particular, I am using sparse MVPA methods to decode motion and depth percepts from fMRI data. For example, I would like to understand if it is possible to decode motion percepts without any signal from area MT, a region that is considered to encode motion percept.
