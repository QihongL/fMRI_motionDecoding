# motionDecoding_fMRI

This project uses sparse methods to decode motion directions from cortical fMRI data, without any anatomical assumption or voxel-preselection. One goal of this research is to see if we can decode motion percepts without any signal from area MT, which is considered to be the area where motion percept is encoded.
